      <p>Pinto beans are the perfect match for white rice in a Brazilian lunch. The mix is so common that there is even a discussion about whether beans should go above or below the rice. For many years it was said that combining foods such as these in one meal was necessary to ensure that our body gets all the essential amino acids, but <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-protein-combining-myth/" target="_blank">this myth has now been debunked</a>.</p>
